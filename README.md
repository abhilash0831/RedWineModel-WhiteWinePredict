# RedWineModel-WhiteWinePredict
Welcome to the "RedWineModel-WhiteWinePredict" repository! Here, you'll find a simple yet powerful machine learning project that leverages a model trained on red wine data to predict the quality of white wine. Dive into the code and explore how I've harnessed the insights from one wine variety to make accurate predictions on another.
